                During my participation in the National Cyber League, I tackled a wide range of
                cybersecurity challenges that tested both technical skill and problem-solving ability.
                I began with <strong>OSINT </strong>investigations uncovering publicly available
                information. From there, I moved into <strong>cryptography</strong>, applying encryption and decryption
                techniques to solve complex puzzles or crack encrypted passwords. I also analyzed network traffic to
                identify anomalies
                and potential vulnerabilities, while system enumeration exercises taught me how to detect
                open ports, services, and exploitable configurations. Finally, I engaged in <strong> password cracking</strong>
                , working with hashed data to retrieve flags and gain deeper insight into
                real-world attack scenarios. Together, these experiences strengthened my ability to think
                critically, adapt quickly, and apply<strong> red-team cybersecurity principles</strong> in practical contexts.

                Through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, I built a strong foundation in
                security principles, including the <strong>CIA triad </strong>and the <strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework</strong>.
                I gained hands-on experience working with Linux and SQL, while also learning SOC
                workflows to understand how security operations are managed in real-world environments.
                Using Wireshark, I learned to <strong>analyze network traffic </strong>and identify potential threats,
                and with Suricata I conducted <strong>vulnerability assessments </strong>while applying risk and asset
                management strategies. I also explored security automation by writing Python scripts
                to streamline repetitive tasks, and studied the importance of playbooks in guiding
                <strong>effective incident response</strong>. Beyond the technical skills, the program emphasized how
                to make an immediate impact as a cybersecurity analyst—integrating seamlessly into a
                team and contributing from the very first day on the job.

              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                As part of the 2025 Annual User Access Review, I managed ticket workflows in collaboration
                with campus MPPs, ensuring clear communication from initiation through follow-up. I verified
                that <strong>Role-Based Access Control</strong> roles were properly aligned with the permissions required for
                different levels of data access, and carefully validated these access levels while documenting
                all outcomes in the Configuration Management Database. To maintain compliance, I reviewed
                employee <strong>security awareness </strong>training records provided by CSU, confirming that all training
                was current and unexpired. For departments that successfully passed the review, I distributed
                certification requests through Adobe Sign, streamlining the approval process. Throughout the
                project, I relied on Excel, our ticketing system and Adobe Sign to record data and compile detailed documentation,
                ensuring that every finding was captured accurately and that the annual review process
                supported both security and accountability across the institution to <strong>uphold our security posture</strong>.

                While working in the Information Security Department, I was assigned to create a KnowledgeBase
                article that would guide Chico State departments in preparing for the annual <strong>Sensitive Data
                  Inventory Survey</strong>. I authored the article, which was published in the ISEC documentation on
                the
                school’s support page, ensuring that departments had clear instructions and resources to
                complete the survey effectively. The article emphasized the importance of <strong>protecting Level 1
                  data </strong>—CSU’s classification for highly sensitive information—and promoted compliance awareness
                by explaining how the survey supported adherence to CSU policy. In doing so, I contributed to
                broader security initiatives by providing clear documentation and communication that reinforced

              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                For this project, I set out to build a web application for my sister’s cosmetics and beauty shop,
                aiming to <strong>solve the challenge of visibility</strong> and give her business a stronger online
                presence.
                The goal was to make her products and services easily accessible to customers through both mobile
                devices and computers. I designed the site with a responsive, mobile-first approach using HTML,
                CSS, and Bootstrap, with a <strong>Node.js and Express.js backend</strong>, ensuring that the layout
                adapted seamlessly across different screen sizes.
                To enhance the user experience, I implemented a modern UI/UX with a custom color palette and
                smooth navigation, creating an inviting and intuitive interface. The platform showcased her
                offerings clearly, while also <strong>incorporating security measures</strong> such as password
                encryption to
                protect user accounts. This early Node.js version of the Kenrish Collection website laid the
                foundation for a secure, user-friendly digital storefront that brought her business into the

                As part of a software development class midterm project, my team and I set out to build a
                fully functional chess game board using <strong>Django</strong>. The goal was to explore how
                Django handles <strong>backend requests</strong> compared to other stacks that rely
                more heavily on client-side rendering. On the frontend, we designed templates with
                <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
                and <strong>JQuery</strong>, ensuring a <strong>responsive</strong> and visually appealing interface.
                The backend was powered by Django and a SQLite3 database, where we
                implemented <strong>models</strong>, <strong>views</strong>, and <strong>URLs</strong> to render the
                board
                accurately. These models provided the foundation of the project, while the
                <strong>views</strong> acted as handlers that connected templates and URLs seamlessly. Movement of chess
                pieces was achieved through a combination of JavaScript and Django backend requests,
                allowing for dynamic interaction across the board. To safeguard user accounts, we applied
                <strong>security best practices</strong> for <strong>form validation</strong>, <strong>signup</strong>,
                <strong>login</strong>, and <strong>logout</strong> functionality. Finally, we documented our progress
                and
                maintained <strong>version control using GitHub</strong>, reinforcing good development practices.
                This project was both challenging and rewarding, offering hands-on experience in blending
                frontend design with backend logic while building something fun and interactive.

                To strengthen my <strong>full-stack Django development</strong> skills, I rebuilt my sister’s cosmetics
                and beauty shop web application with a bold new version that introduced advanced features and improved
                performance. On the frontend, I designed a responsive interface using <strong>Bootstrap</strong>,
                <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, ensuring accessibility and
                smooth navigation. The backend was powered by Django Python and a
                SQLite3 Database, deployed on <strong>AWS EC2</strong> with <strong>DevOps practices</strong>
                that included configuring an <strong>NGINX web server</strong> and Gunicorn service for
                production readiness. Security was a priority throughout the project, with best practices
                implemented for user and form validation, account signup, and login, as well as admin privileges
                management.

              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                Beyond the core functionality, I added insightful <strong>analytics</strong> for administrative users,
                supporting <strong>inventory management</strong>, <strong>accounting</strong>, and <strong>access
                  control</strong>.
                To enhance <strong>User Experience (UX)</strong>, I introduced a <strong>Wishlist feature</strong> that
                allows
                customers to save their favorite products, while refining the User Interface (UI) to be intuitive
                and accessible. Development practices were documented and versioned through <strong>GitHub</strong>,
                reinforcing
                collaboration and maintainability. Finally, I conducted a <strong>threat modeling exercise</strong> and
                used
                <strong>Burp Suite</strong> to assess vulnerabilities, strengthening the application’s security posture
                and ensuring
                both user accounts and administrative pages remained protected. This project not only elevated the
                business’s online
                presence but also deepened my experience in secure, scalable, and user-focused web application
                development.

              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>During the Cal Poly DXHub AI Summer Camp</strong>, my team and I developed a solution to help
                Humboldt University’s research department navigate their website more efficiently, addressing issues
                of clickrage caused by multiple links on a single page. We designed a responsive interface using
                <strong>Streamlit</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, paired with a modern <strong>UI/UX</strong> that
                incorporated custom colors inspired by the Humboldt University website.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                To enhance functionality, we implemented <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> for
                dynamic content generation and leveraged <strong>Amazon Bedrock</strong> for its
                <strong>RetrieveAndGenerate</strong> feature. Data was stored in <strong>Amazon S3 Buckets</strong>
                and indexed with an <strong>S3 vector database</strong>, while <strong>Amazon Knowledge Base</strong>
                features and a <strong>Semantic Chunking Strategy</strong> improved information retrieval and
                contextual understanding. For advanced <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>, we used
                <strong>Titan V2 Embeddings</strong> and <strong>Claude Sonnet</strong>, supported by
                <strong>System Prompt Engineering</strong> to optimize AI model outputs. For security, we implemented
                <strong>Guardrails </strong>
                to monitor and control AI behavior, ensuring safe, accurate and reliable interactions.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                Throughout the project, we documented our progress in <strong>GitHub</strong>, ensuring proper
                version control and adherence to good development practices. Greatest of all we experienced was the
                privilege of meeting
                and collaborating with excellent students from across the <strong>CSU system</strong>, each bringing
                unique professional backgrounds. Together, we built powerful AI solutions that addressed real-world
                problems. Huge thanks to <strong>Ryan Matteson</strong>, <strong>Nick Osterbur</strong>,
                <strong>Darren Kraker</strong>, and all the other admins for creating such a transformative summer camp
                that made a lasting impact on everyone who participated.
